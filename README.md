## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### Continued development

If I was going to spend more time on this, I'd like to work on the visual aspect (this project was solely focused on building with React). The final design is functional but pretty aestetically displeasing.
